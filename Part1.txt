Web Template:

1. Assigns the page/program that will process the form once submitted.

2. Declares the type of superglobal to be used in processing the form; in this case, 
	the $_GET autoglobal will create URL tokens to send the form information.
	
3. Form buttons used as site navigation.

4. This snippet of code uses or displays the declared file. In this case, the file
	included is to display and format a section of the website.
	
5. Checks if the superglobal $_GET has a value appended to the URL for the key 'content'.
	
6. This is a switch clause.

7. Default is included in the switch statements in case a match was not made.

8. If the superglobal was not set then the home page will be displayed after 
	the header section.

Is Prime with Validation:

1. A php function with one parameter; returns true or false.

2. A global variable (declared outside of a function) that is being referenced 
	inside the function.
	
3. Form level variables instantiated to an empty string.

4. The count function returns the number of array references that have content in them.
	Basically, if the user has submitted form, continue.
	
5. The index of the superglobal post array and assigning that data the a variable.

6. Calling a function to see if the input is valid.

9. "Making it sticky": placing the user submitted data back into the form because
	http is stateless and doesn't do this for you.
